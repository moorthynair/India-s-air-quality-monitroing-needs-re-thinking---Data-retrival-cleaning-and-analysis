# India's air quality monitroing needs re-thinking - Data retrival, cleaning and analysis
Basically these are set of codes I used to generate the outputs detailed in my recent peice titled 'India's air quality monitroing needs re-thinking' at Mongabay. 

Use this python code to automatically extract the geolocation of the continuous Ambinet Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) in India.

Use the raw file excel sheet consisting of the CAAQMS infomation downloaded from https://app.cpcbccr.com/ccr/#/caaqm-dashboard-all/caaqm-landing to get the final output excel sheet (Both raw and final output provided for reference)
