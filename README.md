# India's air quality monitroing needs re-thinking - Data retrival, cleaning and analysis
Basically these are set of codes I used to generate the outputs detailed in my recent peice titled 'India's air quality monitroing needs re-thinking'  at Mongabay. In short these set o codes lets you analyse 
a) The total contininous and manual stations operation in the country
b) Total continnous and manual stations required to be operated.

## Step 1: Get the details of Continnous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) opertional across the country.
In this step we download the locations of CAAQMS from the Central Pollution Control Board Website. The CPCB is the custodian who maintains the main data server in co-ordination with various State Pollution Control Boards. It is always good to recheck the dataset as India is laregly growing when it comes o installation and operation of CAAQMS.In this step Visit the CPCB website and follow the instructions illustatred below to download the latest CAAQMS sheet.![170 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83420459/232749429-254cdef1-fcee-4af4-b73f-35d00c10217d.png)
I have this dataset during my period of analysis
